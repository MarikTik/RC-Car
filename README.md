Jesus Take the Wheel - Remote Controlled Car Project

Welcome to the repository of the Jesus Take the Wheel team, where innovation meets control! ðŸš—âœ¨
Project Overview

Ever dreamt of having your own remote-controlled car that responds to your commands effortlessly? Look no further! This project brings to life a seamless interaction between two main components: the Raspberry Pi, aptly named the 'car', and the ESP32, the mastermind controller dictating the car's every move.
Repository Structure

    ESP: This directory houses the brains of our operationâ€”the ESP32 controller. With its intelligence and precision, it takes charge of commanding the motors, ensuring smooth and responsive control.

    RaspberryPi: Behold, the heart and soul of the car! The Raspberry Pi directory encompasses the 'car' itself. Watch as it translates the ESP32's commands into mesmerizing maneuvers.

Car Modes

The extraordinary capabilities of our remote-controlled car don't stop there. Experience the thrill in two exciting modes:

    Remote Control Mode: Grab the virtual wheel and take charge! Direct the car's movements with precision using the ESP32 controller.

    Autonomous Mode: Sit back, relax, and let the car take control. Our sophisticated algorithms enable the car to navigate autonomously, making decisions on the fly for an exhilarating ride.
